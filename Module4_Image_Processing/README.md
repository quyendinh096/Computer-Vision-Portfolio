# Module 4: Introduction to Image Processing

## Overview

This module covers the fundamental concepts and techniques of image processing, including understanding digital images, image enhancement, segmentation, and the use of libraries like OpenCV and Pillow.

### Key Concepts

- **What is Image Processing?**
  - The technique of manipulating and analyzing images to extract meaningful information.
  - **Importance:** Enhances image quality, facilitates data extraction, and enables automated decision-making.

- **Understanding Digital Images:**
  - **Pixels:** Basic units of digital images.
  - **Color Models:** RGB, HSV, and others.
  - **Image Formats:** JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF.

- **Image Processing Techniques:**
  - **Enhancement:** Adjusting contrast, brightness, and reducing noise.
  - **Segmentation:** Dividing an image into meaningful regions.
  - **Restoration:** Removing blurs and correcting distortions.
  - **Compression:** Reducing the size of image files.

### Tools and Libraries

- **OpenCV:** Open-source library for real-time image processing.
- **Pillow:** Python library for basic image manipulation.

### Project: Image Processing Adventure Quest

- **Objective:** Explore fundamental image processing concepts through a creative and interactive adventure quest.
- **Significance:** Gain hands-on experience with image processing techniques and tools.
