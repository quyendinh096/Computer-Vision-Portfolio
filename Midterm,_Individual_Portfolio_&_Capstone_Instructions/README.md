## Individual Porfolio
- **Objective:** Create a comprehensive portfolio that showcases your learning journey throughout the course. Use a GitHub repository to store and organize your work, and prepare a 10-slide PowerPoint presentation summarizing your portfolio. The deliverable is the presentation with a link to your GitHub repository.
