- Explore feature selection and extraction techniques in computer vision.

## Steps

1. **Data Exploration and Preparation:**
   - Load the CIFAR-10 dataset.
   - Visualize some images from the dataset.
   - Convert the images to grayscale and flatten them.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Understand the concept of Support Vector Machine (SVM).
   - Train an SVM classifier using the training set.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Make predictions on the testing set.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy.
   - Visualize some predictions along with their true labels.
