# Module 6: Introduction to Neural Networks

## Overview

This module introduces the fundamentals of neural networks and their applications in machine learning. We'll explore key concepts, network architectures, and training processes using tools like TensorFlow Playground.

### Key Concepts

- **Neural Networks:**
  - Computational models inspired by the human brain.
  - Composed of interconnected neurons organized in layers.

- **Artificial Neuron:**
  - **Inputs:** Raw data points received by the neuron.
  - **Weights:** Importance tags assigned to each input.
  - **Bias:** Adjusted during training.
  - **Activation Function:** Determines the neuron's output.

- **Training Neural Networks:**
  - **Feedforward:** Process input data through the network.
  - **Loss Calculation:** Measure error between predictions and actual outcomes.
  - **Backpropagation:** Adjust weights to minimize loss.
  - **Optimization:** Use algorithms like gradient descent to improve performance.
