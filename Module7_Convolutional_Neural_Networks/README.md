# Module 7: Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview

This module introduces Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful type of neural network used for image processing and computer vision tasks. We'll explore their components, training processes, and real-world applications.

### Key Concepts

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**
  - **Architecture:** Includes input layer, convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
  - **Core Components:** Convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.

- **Training CNNs:**
  - Use of backpropagation and gradient descent for optimizing weights.
  - Techniques like data augmentation and regularization to prevent overfitting.

- **Applications:** CNNs are used in image classification, object detection, medical image analysis, and more.
